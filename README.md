Assignment 4 - Components
===

Due: October 4th, by 11:59 AM.

For this assignment you will re-implement the client side portion of *either* A2 or A3 using either React or Svelte components. If you choose A3 you only need to use components for the data display / updating; you can leave your login UI as is.

[Svelte Tutorial](https://github.com/cs4241-21a/cs4241-21a.github.io/blob/main/using_svelte.md)  
[React Tutorial](https://github.com/cs4241-21a/cs4241-21a.github.io/blob/main/using_react.md)  

This project can be implemented on any hosting service (Glitch, DigitalOcean, Heroku etc.), however, you must include all files in your GitHub repo so that the course staff can view them.

I converted both the form and table components into react components to run the visual elements of the website. This new technology on this small of a scale did not help, although if the website was bigger, I can see how React can aid in reusability. For this assignment specifically, I struggled a lot with the syntax of React and getting components to render, and how to call the components with CSS so that my previous CSS sheet would properly alter the different components. My only issue I had with the CSS was getting the table to align in the center, but left aligned is still fine, just less visually appealing. I do think for smaller assignments, it is not worth using React as the amount of effort put into setting up the app was much greater than it took to simply make html elements. I do think this was a great learning experience and will aid in my final group project.
